## 📝 Description

Pyen is a personal finance application created to promote awareness and increase organization in personal finance. 

A user can login via a Google account. The user will then be able to create entries for each of their bank/brokerage accounts and track their net worth each month. The user will also be able to see the change of their net worth over time through a responsive, animated line graph.

For users who are interested in stocks, they are also able to view upcoming IPOs in the 'IPO Calendar' page. In the 'Stocks List' page, a user can search for a stock and view related stats such as ticker symbol, latest price, and recent price change.
